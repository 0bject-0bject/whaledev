# Whaledev

Whaledev is a simple bot that I use on my server, nothing fancy. It's written in discord.js and currently has no database, but I will probably add one soon.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Fill in the details in .env.example and rename it to .env
4. Run `node index.js`
